Sorting algorithms work with values, such as integers and reals, or more complex types, such as student records or dictionary entries. In both cases, the order of the items is based on the value of a sort key.  The key is the value itself when sorting simple types, or it can be a specific component or a combination of components when sorting complex types. There are many examples of sorting in everyday life.  Consider listings in a phone book, definitions in a dictionary, or terms in an index, all of which are alphabetized to make it easier to find an entry. The efficiency of some algorithms like search algorithms can be improved when working with sorted arrays.  Another common use of sorting is to present data in an organized manner. For example, we may want to sort a class list by student name, sort a list of cities by zip code or population, sort SAT scores or list entries on a bank statement by date.
